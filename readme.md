## Project Overview

- **Current Ratio Gauge**: Tracks Apple's ability to meet short-term obligations with a current ratio of 0.8673 and a quick ratio of 0.0746.
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio Over Time**: Compares Apple's leverage against an industry benchmark of 2.0, showing a consistent trend above this mark.
- **Cash Balance Over Time**: Displays trends in Apple's cash reserves, peaking at 60B in 2024.
- **Retained Earnings Trend**: Highlights a sharp decline in retained earnings to -19.94B by 2024.
- **Debt vs. Equity Composition**: Illustrates the balance between debt and equity financing, with debt peaking in 2023.
- **Burn Rate (Monthly Cash Depletion)**: Monitors cash outflow patterns, showing volatility with a peak in 2023.

These visualizations provide a holistic view of Apple's financial status, making it easier to spot trends, risks, and opportunities.

## Key Insights
- **Liquidity**: Apple's current ratio of 0.8673 is below 1.0, signaling potential short-term liquidity risks, though its cash balance may mitigate this.
- **Leverage**: The debt-to-equity ratio remains above the industry benchmark of 2.0, indicating higher financial risk but potentially strategic use of debt.
- **Cash Reserves**: Apple's cash balance shows a general upward trend, with a significant spike to 60B in 2024.
- **Retained Earnings**: A decline to -19.94B by 2024 raises concerns about profitability or dividend policies.
- **Burn Rate**: A volatile burn rate in 2023 (peaking at 15B) suggests significant cash outflows, warranting further investigation.
