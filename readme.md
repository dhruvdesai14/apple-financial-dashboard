- **Leverage**: The financial risk level increases yet debt use at a ratio above the 2.0 industry standard shows strategic possibilities.
- **Cash Reserves**: Apple maintains rising cash reserves which experience a substantial increase to reach 60B during 2024.
- **Retained Earnings**: The future decrease in retained earnings to -19.94B presents financial concerns regarding dividend plans and profitability.
